# Tic-Tac-Toe
-----------------------
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game to showcase using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, BEM, and interacting with the DOM.

#About 
-----------------------
The game allows two players, one being the X player and the other O player. The game rules are as follows:
- The game is played on a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares.
- The starting player is X and the other player is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares by clicking on the desired square.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.


#Display
-----------------------

The game contains a game state display above the restart button. This will display either that the current player (either x or o) should pay their turn,
or it will display a win state (either X win or O win), and lastly a tie state. 

You can restart the game at anytime using the restart button at the bottom of the game display.
